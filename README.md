#MaltReport

MaltReport is an OpenDocument/OfficeOpenXML powered reporting engine for .NET and Mono, it is inspired by the excellent [Relatorio Project](http://relatorio.openhex.org/).

MaltReport DO NOT requires MS-Office or LibreOffice to render report, instead MaltReport manipulates ODT/ODS/XLS/DOC file by itself, so it fast & reliable. 

The template of your report is just a normal document created with LibreOffice or MS-Word/MS-Excel (ODT/ODS and XLS/DOC are fully supported), 
we can use LibreOffice and MS-Word/Excel as WYSIWYG report development tools.

I do not have too much time working with the document, so to learn the usage of MaltReport please see the Sandwych.Reporting.Demo project.
